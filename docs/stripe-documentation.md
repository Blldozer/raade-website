## Link
*Link* allows your customers to select a saved payment method at checkout instead of entering payment information. Your customers can save their credit cards, debit cards, or US bank accounts for faster checkout at any Link-enabled business. Link also lets you accept Instant Bank Payments. All Link transactions confirm immediately, and successful payments settle to your Stripe balance on the same timeline as card payments, regardless of the payment method that funds the payment. Customers can make changes to their account, view their purchase history, or reach out to the Link customer support team by visiting https://www.link.com. For information about how your payment integration affects Link, see [Link in different payment integrations](https://docs.stripe.com.md). Link isn't available in India.
