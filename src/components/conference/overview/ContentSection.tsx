          At RAADE's Annual Conference, we will come together to translate bold ideas into 
          continent-wide impact. This isn't just a conferenceâ€”it's where change-makers like you 
          come together to shape tomorrow. Because we know Africa's future won't be built by 
          distant strategies, but by people in rooms like this, turning possibilities into reality.
